    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This project focuses on implementing and analyzing various <strong>graph algorithms</strong> using <strong>Python</strong>. 
        It supports both <strong>directed and undirected graphs</strong> and includes fundamental traversal techniques 
        such as <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong>. Additionally, the project covers specialized algorithms for 
        working with <strong>Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)</strong> and detecting <strong>cliques</strong>, making it a 
        versatile tool for studying graph-based computations.
