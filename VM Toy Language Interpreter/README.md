    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This project is a <strong>VM Toy Language Interpreter</strong> implemented in <strong>Java</strong>. 
        It follows the <strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</strong> design pattern and features a graphical user interface built with <strong>JavaFX</strong>. 
        The interpreter executes programs written in a custom toy language, providing a structured way to analyze and debug virtual machine operations. 
        The GUI offers an intuitive interface for users to write, execute, and visualize the execution process of their programs.
